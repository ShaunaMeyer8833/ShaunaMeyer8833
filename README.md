## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m a backend developer working with Ruby on Rails to build full-featured, scalable web applications. This repository highlights how I structure backend systems with a focus on clean RESTful API design, efficient database management, and robust background job processing.

I use Railsâ€™ conventions to design APIs that are predictable, well-organized, and easy to consume. Controllers follow REST principles closely, and I emphasize consistent status codes, clear parameter handling, and versioning strategies when needed. For serialization, I often work with tools like ActiveModel::Serializers or Fast JSONAPI to keep API responses fast and well-structured.

On the database side, I rely heavily on Active Record for managing models and associations, while using migrations to evolve schemas cleanly over time. I aim for normalized, relational structures but also use PostgreSQL features like JSONB and full-text search where appropriate. I place a strong emphasis on query optimization, indexing, and ensuring data integrity through validations and constraints.

To offload non-critical tasks and improve app responsiveness, I use background jobs powered by tools like Sidekiq or Delayed Job. Whether it's sending emails, processing uploads, or syncing with third-party services, background processing helps keep the core request cycle fast and reliable. Jobs are written with retry logic, monitoring, and idempotency in mind.

This repository reflects how I build backend systems that are both developer-friendly and production-ready. Whether youâ€™re looking to learn more about Rails architecture or need a solid starting point for your own project, I hope this codebase provides some practical value.
